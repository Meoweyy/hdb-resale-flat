# hdb-resale-flat
This is a mini project for SC1015 where our group decided to analyse and predict HDB Resale Flat Prices.
The following python project consists of:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Cleaning
3. 3 Machine Learning Models
4. Conclusion

# Contributors:
  - @shamz-10: EDA,m Data Cleaning, Linear Regression
  - @Maaxxx002: Decision Tree Regressor
  - Ethan: Random Tree Regressor

# Problem Definition:
How can we predict the prices of resale flat to help people decide if they want buy a resale flat? 
Variables used to analyse:
a. Location (North, South, East, West, Central)
b. Storey range (Upper/Lower)
c. Flat Type (1 Room...5 Room, Exec. Apt)
d. Floor Area
e. Remaining Lease
   

# Models used:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Tree Regressor

# Conclusion
After analysing all 3 models, it was evident that the Random Forrest Regressor is the best model in predicting Resale Flat Prices. This is because the adjusted R^2 for it is the highest amonngst the 3 models.
