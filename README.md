# hdb-resale-flat
This is a mini project for SC1015 where our group decided to analyse and predict HDB Resale Flat Prices.
The following python project consists of:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Cleaning
3. 3 Machine Learning Models
4. Conclusion

  - @Maaxxx002: Decision Tree Regressor
  - @meoweyy: Random Tree Regressor

# Problem Definition:
How can we predict the prices of resale flat to help people decide if they want buy a resale flat? 

# Variables used to analyse:
- Location (North, South, East, West, Central)
- Storey range (Upper/Lower)
- Flat Type (1 Room...5 Room, Exec. Apt)
- Floor Area
- Remaining Lease

   

# Models used:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Tree Regressor

# Conclusion
After analysing all 3 models, it was evident that the Random Forrest Regressor is the best model in predicting Resale Flat Prices. This is because it has the highest mean squared error amongst the 3 models.
